# python-rock-paper-scissors
A simple Python program that plays the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors

# Prerequisites
This game utilzies Python's PrettyTable to tabulate score, so you need to make sure that it is installed before running.
```bash
# python version < 3
pip install PTable

# or if using > python3
pip3 install PTable
```

# How to Play
The game asks for various inputs, all you need to do is read them and answer with the corresponding values.

There are currently two game choices:
 - You vs. Computer
 - You vs. Player
 
 You can play different lengths of games by specifying `more` when prompted. The default is best 2/3 games.
 
 There is also a line in the `main.py` file for Windows users to keep track of score if you are playing it there. 
 Otherwise this defaults to a UNIX/LINUX platform for file location.
